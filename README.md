# Who I am
Hello! My name is Cole Dobmeier and I am a teen based out of in Colorado and an aspiring Computer Science Student. In college I plan to study Computer Science and the related fields in order to deepen my knowledge. Currently, I am enrolled at [Epic Campus](https://littletonpublicschools.net/schools/epiccampus/welcome), an innovative pathway that provides crucial first person experience in many pathways. I am taking part in the Computer Science pathway, where we have taken a multitude of college tours and learned the intricies of python, the depths of AI, and how to use code to manipulate real world objects. Additionally, I am enrolled in AP Computer Science A at my home high school where I have learnt the basics of Java and recently competed in the Code Quest Competition at Lockheed Martin with a top 15 finish. If you have any questions about what you see below, please feel free to email me at [cwd495@gmail.com](mailto:cwd495@gmail.com)!

**Description:**
 A two-part project focusing on GPIO pin management and integrating a 7-segment display with a Raspberry Pi.
**Features:**
- GPIO Cleanup Script: Turned off all Raspberry Pi GPIO pins programmatically.
- 7-Segment Display Integration: Displayed personalized messages with user input.
- Stopwatch Application: Button-controlled stopwatch with a light bulb indicator and time display on a 7-segment display.

**Technologies:**  
 - Python Programming
 - Raspberry Pi & BreadBoard Circuitry
